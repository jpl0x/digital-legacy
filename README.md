## Why I'm Building This

I'm building this for my son. I want to leave him something meaningfulâ€”not just photos or videos, but a way to ask me questions, get advice, and know how I think, even when I'm no longer here.

- **Week 1:** Database + journal system âœ…
- **Week 2-3:** Refactor + clean architecture âœ…
- **Week 3-4:** User authentication
- **Week 4-6:** AI chat integration
- **Week 7-8:** Guided prompts + personality framework
- **Month 3+:** Voice cloning, beneficiary system, production features
